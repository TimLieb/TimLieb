[SQL Portfolio](https://github.com/TimLieb/SQL-and-Tableau-Portfolio) is a project on manipulating and visualising sales data from a car manufacturer dataset. I have been able to develop my SQL and Tableau skills through this, alongside knowledge on RDBMS and data visualisation.

[Excel-Portfolio](https://github.com/TimLieb/Excel-Portfolio) displays the Excel skills that I've accumulated as an accountant. This includes a sales ledger INDEX MATCH, a fixed asset register and a sheet used to aggregate totals.
