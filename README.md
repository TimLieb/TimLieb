Thank you for viewing my profile. My name is Tim and you're likely here because I put this link on my job application.

I'm aspiring to work in the field of Data Analytics and in order to pursue this, I've created a portfolio to demonstrate my ability and potential through my projects.

[SQL Portfolio](https://github.com/TimLieb/Excel-Portfolio) is a project on manipulating and visualising sales data from a car manufacturer dataset. I have been able to develop my SQL and Tableau skills through this, alongside knowledge on RDBMS and data visualisation.

Excel-Portfolio displays the Excel skills that I've accumulated as an accountant. This includes a sales ledger INDEX MATCH, a fixed asset register and a sheet used to aggregate totals.
