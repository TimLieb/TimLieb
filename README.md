Hello and thank you for viewing my profile, my name is Tim and you're likely here because I put this link on my job application.

I'm looking to become an apprentice data analyst but currently work as an accountant.

In order to find such an apprenticeship I've created two portfolios to demonstrate my ability and potential. Please view them in
"Repositiories".

One portfolio shows my excel skills which I've accumulated as an accountant. I realise that data analysts typically try to limit
their use of excel as it isn't well equiped for handling large quantities of data and it lacks functionality. Be this as it may I
self taught myself a great deal about it for use in my current job and would like you to see it as a demonstration of how 
capable I am of learning advanced data manipulation techniques. This portfolio includes a powerpoint presentation and three spreadsheets.

The other portfolio shows the knowledge and skills I have recently taught myself about SQL and Tableau for the purpose of demonstrating 
to potential employers how capable I am of using similar RDBMS's and visualisation software. This portfolio includes a PDF which explains
the portfolio, a link to my Tableau web page and finally an SQL script.

Should you wish to contact me please email me at: tliebermann.33@gmail.com
